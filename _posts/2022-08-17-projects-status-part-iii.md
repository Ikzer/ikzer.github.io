The second kind of projects are the ones that are somehow planned, maybe repo created, but never worked beyond that. There are quite a few of these, and most of them will be merged on more recent ones or discarded in the following month.

## Comics Reading Lists

Inspired by _[Marvel Guides](marvelguides.com)_ and _[Comic Book Herald](https://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/)_ I want to create a site that can serve both as a storyline guide as well as a buying guide. The first one only shows the single issues ordered by themed arcs, not actually storylines, which is something that I want to keep but expand, and the second one is more like a blog with a list. I want an interactive list that can be seen as single-issue stories or as TPBs with links to buy them online. 

The idea is that we have a database of issues and TPBs, and we can add them to ordered "reading guides". All extra information about the comics could be retrieved from APIs or extending our own API in the future.

Tl;Dr: Single-issue and TPBs reading guides thematically sorted.

## TTRPG Logsheets

As a Dungeon Master or Narrator I want a place where I store my session logsheets and campagin tracking. Simple as that. Nothign fancy like _[WorldAnvil](worldanvil.com)_, just simple logsheets customized per game. 

Maybe a NoSQL database with non-schematic documents or something like that would help.

## JavaScript game development tutorials

One of my hobbies is game development. But I never finish a single thing. But I've learned a lot. But I want to learn more. And gamedev is fantastic to learn algorithms and lots of fancy stuff. And I have an idea. I will make self-tutorials.

So here is how this is gonna be: in phases, like the _console gaming generations_, I will try to re-create iconic games from each time (within boundaries) to learn how they were made and how to adapt them to modern technologies. At first I will make them in JavaScript, in the future I will go to Unity for more complex games.

In a future post I will extend this since is the main thing I want to do on this blog.

## LoT

LoT is a story that we started with my brothes a long, long time ago to make a big JRPG-like videogame. I want to honor that and start developing it, not only codewise but as a whole big videogame production project. This means lots of engineering, pre-production, art and more, so it will be slow. But we will do it.

## Summary

With the things that I already started I have a lot of work, but this four projects have been on the top of my head for a long time so it was time to start them or let them go. Guess what I chose?

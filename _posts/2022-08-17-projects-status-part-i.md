The point of this blog is to have a status of all my current and future projects. And here is the first part: the projects I have started until now.

They are in a wide variety of statuses, but mainly at very early stages of development. I started most of them to learn things that I have since learned from other sources so I stalled them, but now I want to continue, finish or scrap them. Put my things together.

This first part is for the projects that have some work done, maybe are in a somewhat working status and can be improved.

## Ikzer.github.io
![v1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green "version 1.0.0")

This site!

This blog is in its first version with plans to extend it as I learn more about this kind of sites and as I feel like adding something new.

## Manga List
![v0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-red "version 0.1.0")

With the page _Listado Manga_ as example, I'm making a NextJS site that tracks releases of comics/manga in _different markets_, not only Spain as the aforementioned web. It should have the option to filter by market. I might add user registration and lists in the future.

## Clicker
![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

This is a web based Civilization clone using jQuery and Bootstrap.

I started it as an experiment to try things with jQuery while making a simple clicker game based on _Travian_ and _Clicker Heroes_. It's in a really early stage, with almost no styles or gameplay added.

## Art Frontend
![v0.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.2-blue "version 0.0.2")

One of my hobbies is drawing. I actually have a parallel persona that posts art on socials and get commissions from time to time. Maybe one day I'll share that. Now is not that time.

To the point. This project is an art pieces manager. I used to create tons of pieces a month when I didn't have a job that it became unmanageable to do by head or on folders. Then I decided to make a manager and learn some GraphQL while doing it. This is the frontend made with create-react-app, using GraphQL on a backend server that I managed with Strapi but I'll migrate to Express in a new project.

## Mangalist
![v0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-black "version 0.1.0")

Probably the first project to be deleted or merged into the current NextJS Manga List project, this is an old attempt to do a catalogue of my collection, that evolved into a buying list that evolved into a database of manga. All of the functionality will be refactored in _Manga List_ but for now I'll keep it.

## Spacemap
![v0.0.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.2-blue "version 0.0.2")

Using Leaflet and some tweaks I started to make a map of the galaxy and beyond for a sci-fi project I'm working on the side.

## Jav Display
![v0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-black "version 0.1.0")

The project from where the old _Mangalist_ forked, it was a visual display of movie covers, with some functionality to add items dynamically, add castings to the movies and change dates and status. All of the funcionality will be merged into the new Manga List so this will be eliminated soon or reworked on a new project.

## LoT Map
![v0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-lightgrey "version 0.1.0")

This is subproject that needs to be placed on a new repo, since the main part is a game concept that will be scratched.

It's a map using Leaflet for routes like in Pokemon for a new game that I'll be working on next year.

## Compras
![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

Database of the things I bought since 31/07/2018. Absurdly out of date. Some of the code will be used on the new _Manga List_ and the this repo will be deleted.

------

## Summary

There are 9 projects on the work according to this list but three of them will be deleted soon since they will be somewhat integrated on others, one of them is this blog so it's not actually an active project to develop and two of them are very similar so maybe they could be merged. So there are actually 4 projects on this state. It may seem a lot but it's not that bad.

TO-DO: the things listed above.

The part 2 is about started but not worked on projects.

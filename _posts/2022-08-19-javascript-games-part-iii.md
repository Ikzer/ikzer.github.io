The so-called first generation of consoles were on sale between 1972 and 1980 and included the Magnavox Odyssey, Telstar, Home Pong and Color TV-Game, and before that there were some arcade games that became very famous and are iconic.

Mainly this are simple arcade games, with basic mechanics but that establish some of the most durable things we now have: boundaries, moving elements, player stats and so on. Yes, someone had to do it first.

The more significant games I want to cover are:

- Asteroids
- Baseball
- Demon Attack
- Donkey Kong
- Missile Command
- Pitfall!
- Utopia
- Zaxxon

It's a lot but well, here are most of the most basic mechanics that everything after have repeated. I plan to do this in about four months, perhaps before end of the year. Now on to the next generation!

After the first basic arcade games it's time to explore modern genres. These games are much more complex so this will take more time but if everything goes as expected they shouldn't be too difficult, just time consuming.

The genres to cover here will be:

## 2D Platform

Platformers are fun games focused on level design to give them variety. From Donkey Kong to Super Mario, Prince of Persia, to more modern like Disney's Aladdin, Sonic or Megaman they are very different. The idea here is to make the first two, Donkey Kong and Mario, as they are genre defining and iconic.

## 2D JRPG

Japanese companies like Square and Enix absolutely dominated a new genre in the 80's and created lasting sagas that survived to this day with great success. The idea here is to make a 2D RPG like Final Fantasy, not as complex of course but the main mechanics will be there.

## 2D Fighting

This is one that I currently have zero idea on how to do. It will be a challenge. i'll try to keep it classic, nothing fancy. Something like the first Street Fighter or even earlier games. We'll see.

## 2D Racing

One of the firsts "advanced" games that we all played were racing games. But instead of making those NES old games I'll try something more like F-Zero.

## Roguelike

Nowadays almost all the indie studios make roguelikes. Procedural levels are the hottest thing now. But they were around since the 90's. I'll try a dungeon generator to make an infinite roguelike game.

## Tower Platformer

The last of this pack will be another kind of platformer that nobody makes anymore: tower platformers, like Donkey Kong or others. To relax after all the previous this one will be the end of the Phase 2.

I hope to make these in the first quarter of 2023, but only time will tell.

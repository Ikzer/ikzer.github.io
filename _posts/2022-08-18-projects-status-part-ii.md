The second kind of projects are the ones that are somehow planned, maybe repo created, but never worked beyond that. There are quite a few of these, and most of them will be merged on more recent ones or discarded in the following month.

## Mangalist

![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

Probably the first project to be deleted or merged into the current NextJS Manga List project, this is an old attempt to do a catalogue of my collection, that evolved into a buying list that evolved into a database of manga. All of the functionality will be refactored in _Manga List_ but for now I'll keep it.

## Simulation

![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

One of my side projects is the worldbuilding for a sci-fi novels/comics series that I want to do somewhen in the future. But as the geek I am, I don't want to just write stuff: I want generators. For starters I made a simple simulator of economies and populations over time for a made-up planet a while ago. I liked where that was going but since I wanted to evolve it I decided to try React as a framework to rework all the funcionality making it more usable.

For now I just created the project, no code was added yet.

## Cards Catalogue

![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

Similar to the Manga List, this will be a catalogue for TCG and LCG games like YuGiOh or Marvel Champions. I think I'll use NextJS, Express and MongoDB

## CivClick

![v0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-black "version 0.0.1")

Similar to the Part 1 Clicker project, this was an attempt to do it with Laravel that was a failure thus needs to be deleted.

## Summary

There are only four projects in this category, one of them will be deleted and two of them will be started soon so pretty good here. The next and final part will be the future. And there things get messy.

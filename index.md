# Ikzer Dev Blog

Web developer trying all kind of things.

I go as Ikzer on the web since my teenage years and now it's too late to change that.

I try to post about the projects I'm currently working on and some (very few) things about my actual day-to-day job.

Hope you enjoy and find something useful from time to time!

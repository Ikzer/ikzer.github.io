Besides code and work, I have a few other side projects I'm working on. I've mentioned I do art and illustration for example. I used to play the bass a few years ago. I do a lot of stuff. Let's breakdown everything and see where is everything and try to keep up and track it from now.

1. [Code](#code)
2. [YouTube](#youtube)
3. [Art](#art)
   1. [Patreon](#patreon)
   2. [DnD 4-strips](#dnd-4-strips)
   3. [Kuga](#kuga)
   4. [PBP](#pbp)
   5. [SD](#sd)
   6. [OmniVerses](#omniverses)
4. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

# Code

I made series about my [code projects here](/2022/08/18/projects-status-part-i) so not much to say about that. I'm focusing mainly on the Manga List project and the [JavaScript game development](/2022/08/19/javascript-games-part-i) journey. That would be the easiest things to track here.

# YouTube

I started a YouTube channel about my biggest passion: manga. Is in Spanish and ther I talk about things I read, things I like, and, more importantly, things I buy. I'll make [~~a post about it~~](/2023/09/19/youtube-planning) soon.

# Art

I have an abandoned Patreon and a Twitter art account that I plan to revive. I started a few series of fanarts that I want to continue, or that I had planned but not continued, but that will have to wait for the time being because I have new interests: comics. I read comics and manga, lots of them, since more than 20 years ago. And now that I make my own art I started planning my own comic projects.
As with everything, I started to get on top. So right now I have *five* comic projects. I don't plan to make a big deal of them so I'm taking this sloooowly. Nonetheless I want to go with this.
This is the status of each one.

## Patreon

I plan these monthly, and starting on November I'll limit the amount of them since sometimes I made tons of them and then can't keep up.

1. November Pieces (0/4)
2. November Private Pieces (0/2)

## DnD 4-strips

This is a recent project that I plan to start posting on October. They are simple comical strips of Dungeons and Dragons characters being themselves. It's an exercise on narrative I'm trying before comitting to more serious comic projects, which I am planning.

These are also planned monthly: Month (done/planned).

1. October (1/10)
2. November (0/10)
3. December (0/10)

## Kuga

The last four years I DM'd a long campaign of Dungeon and Dragons with a group of good friends. It became an epic with well developed characters, lots of adventures and twists. So once finished (or at least that part of their adventure) I decided to make a comic series of that story.

The format will be classic 24 page full color comic-books.

| Issue | Pages | Story | Script | Storyboard | Draft | Ink | Color | Render |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-----|-------|--------|----|
| 1 | 24 | 100% | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
| 2 | 24 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
| 3 | 24 | 50% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
| 4 | 24 | 0% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0

## PBP

This is a manga style fighting tournament story that started as something completely different but slowly evolved into this. I have this planned for a long run, I know it will be difficult but I really want to do it.

As of now I have loosely plotted:

- 11 Sagas
- 37 Story Arcs
- 86 Chapters (for the first 7 story arcs)
- 70 Pages (for the first 2 chapters)

I know, it's a lot.

## SD

To experiment with the webcomic format I'm plotting another series based on fanarts mostly, kind of a *doujinshi* thing.

With this I have plotted:

- 2 Story Arcs
- 6 Chapters
- 60 Pages

## OmniVerses

The one I have been planning the longest is a sci-fi space opera that I'm working on with some code projects. I have not written anything yet, but I have a huge bible of stuff that It will include. This will take time.

# Conclusion

Artwise I have a lot to do, and I actually don't have time to do all this but well, I like to plan stuff that "maybe someday" I want to do. Now that I'm organizing my time and projects, putting this togeteher is helping to plan what to do with my time better and schedule time to work on them. We'll see if starting September things start rolling.

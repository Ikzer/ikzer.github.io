I've tried this before but now that I have a more stable job I have my life more organized and I will try to maintain this. I thought it would be fun to talk about some of the personal projects I work on at home. 
I enjoy writing and sharing; it's been a long time since the last time, let's hope this is the one.
I'll try to make the posts accesible, but I don't know how well that's going to be. Most of them will be pretty technical, not very deep at the beginning tho.

Just to name a few of my interests besides coding...
* Comics/Series/Movies
* Art/Illustration
* Music
* Dogs

If any of this sounds interesting to you, then I hope you stick around and check in from time to times. I may use new socials in the future, but for now they are personal and in Spanish.

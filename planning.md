## Future Posts

I actually have all of these almost ready to post, but I don't want to waste them in a single day so I will polish them and publish them one at a time. The _???_ are posts that are almost finished but I don't want to unveil yet.

This isn't set in stone tho, but it's pretty accurate on how I want to post them for now.
